Hi! My name is Zaw Maung. I have an advanced understanding of HTML5 and modern web development practices.

I always write semantic and accessible markup — using , , , , , and  so both humans and screen readers can understand my page structure easily.

I’m also familiar with WCAG accessibility standards — I make sure every image has alt text, every form has labels, and navigation can be done entirely with a keyboard.

I regularly use HTML5 features such as forms with native validation,  and  for media, and  tags for SEO and responsiveness.

I always test for cross-browser compatibility - User Experience (UX) - and use progressive enhancement so that even older browsers can handle the core content.

In summary, I write clean, well-structured, accessible HTML that’s easy to maintain, performs well, and works across devices and browsers.

Thank you!
